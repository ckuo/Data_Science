    "In Thailand, the vibrant market of social media presents a unique landscape for marketing, particularly within the growing landscape of Facebook Live Selling. As a nation that embraces digital interaction, understanding user engagement on platforms such as Facebook is crucial for tailoring content strategies that engage with the audience. This analysis will evaluate the belief that photos are the ideal medium for maximizing user engagement on social media. By looking at the different metrics, the study aims to empirically assess the impact of photo content relative to other content types. Therefore, this analysis will use advanced analytical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), logistic regression, and k-means clustering, to provide an understanding of content performance. The outcomes of this analysis will serve as a scope for strategic content planning, steering marketing efforts towards data-driven decisions in the dynamic landscape of Thai social media commerce."

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "Videos seem to be the leading content type in terms of total and average engagement, particularly driven by a high number of comments, which suggests a higher level of interaction and possibly longer viewing time or discussion. Moreover, photos, while not reaching the engagement levels of videos, still show strong performance, especially in likes, indicating that they are well-received content for quick consumption and appreciation. However, text content has the least total engagement but a higher than expected average engagement per post. \n"

    "This scree plot displays the variance explained by each principal component in the PCA analysis. The y-axis shows the variance explained, and the x-axis lists the principal components. The first point (PC0) is the highest, explaining the most variance. The second point (PC1) shows a significant drop but still accounts for a good amount of variance. After PC2, marked by the dotted red line, there's an 'elbow' in the plot, where the line begins to flatten out, indicating that additional components explain progressively less variance. This leveling off suggests that PC0 through PC2 are the most informative for understanding the structure in the data, and further components contribute less to the total variance explained. \n",

    "This value indicates that the first principal component explains approximately 45% of the variance in the dataset. It's the largest proportion compared to the other components. This signifies that this component captures the most significant pattern or structure within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The second dot (PC 1: 0.125) \n",
    "This value indicates that the second principal component explains approximately 12.5% of the variance in the dataset. Although this is a considerable drop from the first component, it still represents a significant pattern in the data that is different from what is captured by the first component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The second dot (PC 2: 0.12) \n",
    "This value indicates that the second principal component explains approximately 12% of the variance in the dataset.  It is lower than the second, indicating that it captures less of the data's structure but still provides some meaningful information that was not captured by the first two components."

    "In this principal component analysis, the most significant features are num_loves (0.50), num_shares (0.49), and num_comments (0.41), all of which show strong positive loadings on PC0. This suggests that PC0 shows a dimension of social media interaction primarily driven by user engagement and positive feedback. A high score on PC0 could imply content that is not only commonly shared and liked but also evokes a strong connection with the audience, leading to a greater number of comments and 'love' reactions. The content that aligns with this component is likely to be uplifting or compelling, prompting a shared sense of community or appreciation among users.\n",

    "PC1 is characterized by a high positive loading on num_likes (0.73) and num_wows (0.48) , indicating that this component represents the general appeal or acceptance of content among the audience. The high positive loadings on num_likes (0.73) and num_wows (0.48), likely show content that is widely appreciated and often elicits a reaction of amazement or impressive acknowledgment from viewers. The strong correlation with num_likes suggests a broad approval of the content, indicating that the audience like the content. On the other hand, the num_wows implies that such content also has the capacity to surprise or exceed expectations, leading to higher engagement.\n",

    "INTERPRETATION 2\n",
    "The final component, PC2, the important feature is num_angrys (0.63) with a strong positive loading. This indicates that it captures the social media content that triggers user discontent. This component might be representative of provocative content that divides viewers and elicits a strong emotional reaction, particularly one of annoyance or frustration. This suggests that the content is likely causing a stir and provoking a negative response. It reflects the kind of posts that spark a heated reaction and get people fired up."

The first point (PC0) is the highest, explaining the most variance. The second point (PC1) shows a significant drop but still accounts for a good amount of variance. After PC2, marked by the dotted red line, there's an 'elbow' in the plot, where the line begins to flatten out, indicating that additional components explain progressively less variance. This leveling off suggests that PC0 through PC2 are the most informative for understanding the structure in the data, and further components contribute less to the total variance explained."

This is by far the largest cluster, suggesting that the majority of the data points share a set of characteristics that are similar to each other according to the clustering algorithm's criteria. Since this cluster has the majority of data points, the attributes defining this cluster could be seen as representative of the dataset's overall trends or the most common shared features among the data points analyzed.\n",

    "Contains 135 data points. This is a significantly smaller group than Cluster 1, indicating that fewer data points share the characteristics that define this cluster. This substantial difference in size compared to Cluster 1 indicates that the characteristics defining this cluster are less commonly shared among the dataset. The attributes or patterns this cluster represents might be less frequent or more specific compared to those of Cluster 1, suggesting a more niche grouping within the overall data.\n",

This cluster may represent a more distinct or less common set of characteristics in the data compared to the other two. Being the least populous cluster, it implies that the data points within it share a set of characteristics that are even less common or more unique within the dataset. This cluster may highlight specific or rare conditions, behaviors, or features present in the data, which are not as prevalent as those found in the larger clusters.\n",
