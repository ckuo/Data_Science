    "In Thailand, the vibrant market of social media presents a unique landscape for marketing, particularly within the growing landscape of Facebook Live Selling. As a nation that embraces digital interaction, understanding user engagement on platforms such as Facebook is crucial for tailoring content strategies that engage with the audience. This analysis will evaluate the belief that photos are the ideal medium for maximizing user engagement on social media. By looking at the different metrics, the study aims to empirically assess the impact of photo content relative to other content types. Therefore, this analysis will use advanced analytical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), logistic regression, and k-means clustering, to provide an understanding of content performance. The outcomes of this analysis will serve as a scope for strategic content planning, steering marketing efforts towards data-driven decisions in the dynamic landscape of Thai social media commerce."

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "Videos seem to be the leading content type in terms of total and average engagement, particularly driven by a high number of comments, which suggests a higher level of interaction and possibly longer viewing time or discussion. Moreover, photos, while not reaching the engagement levels of videos, still show strong performance, especially in likes, indicating that they are well-received content for quick consumption and appreciation. However, text content has the least total engagement but a higher than expected average engagement per post. \n"

    "This scree plot displays the variance explained by each principal component in the PCA analysis. The y-axis shows the variance explained, and the x-axis lists the principal components. The first point (PC0) is the highest, explaining the most variance. The second point (PC1) shows a significant drop but still accounts for a good amount of variance. After PC2, marked by the dotted red line, there's an 'elbow' in the plot, where the line begins to flatten out, indicating that additional components explain progressively less variance. This leveling off suggests that PC0 through PC2 are the most informative for understanding the structure in the data, and further components contribute less to the total variance explained. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The first dot (PC 0: 0.45) \n",
    "For PC0, which represents the first principal component, its high value of approximately 45% indicates that it explains a significant portion of the variance in the dataset, suggesting that it captures the most prominent patterns or trends within the data. This makes PC0 crucial for understanding the fundamental structure of the dataset and identifying its primary underlying features. Additionally, PC0's dominance in variance explained implies that it may correspond to a key dimension along which the data points vary the most. Therefore, analyzing the relationship between variables and PC0 can offer valuable insights into the primary factors driving variation in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The second dot (PC 1: 0.125) \n",
    "Moving to PC1, which accounts for around 12.5% of the variance, it represents a substantial but comparatively smaller portion of the dataset's variability. Despite this, PC1 still captures meaningful patterns that differ from those captured by PC0, providing additional insights into the dataset's structure. By examining the loading scores of variables on PC1, one can identify the specific aspects of the data that contribute most to this component's variance. This analysis can help uncover secondary patterns or trends that are distinct from those identified by PC0, enriching the overall understanding of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The third dot (PC 2: 0.12) \n",
    "Finally, PC2, with an explained variance of approximately 12%, contributes further to understanding the dataset's structure by capturing additional patterns not fully represented by PC0 and PC1. While PC2 explains less variance than PC0 and PC1, its insights are still valuable for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's underlying characteristics. By exploring the relationship between variables and PC2, I can uncover unique features or relationships that contribute to the dataset's ingormation. Thus, collectively analyzing PC0, PC1, and PC2 allows for a more understanding of the dataset's variability and underlying structure.\n",

    "In this principal component analysis, the most significant features are num_loves (0.50), num_shares (0.49), and num_comments (0.41), all of which show strong positive loadings on PC0. This suggests that PC0 shows a dimension of social media interaction primarily driven by user engagement and positive feedback. A high score on PC0 could imply content that is not only commonly shared and liked but also evokes a strong connection with the audience, leading to a greater number of comments and 'love' reactions. The content that aligns with this component is likely to be uplifting or compelling, prompting a shared sense of community or appreciation among users.\n",
    "\n",
    "INTERPRETATION 1\n",
    "PC1 is characterized by a high positive loading on num_likes (0.73) and num_wows (0.48) , indicating that this component represents the general appeal or acceptance of content among the audience. The high positive loadings on num_likes (0.73) and num_wows (0.48), likely show content that is widely appreciated and often elicits a reaction of amazement or impressive acknowledgment from viewers. The strong correlation with num_likes suggests a broad approval of the content, indicating that the audience like the content. On the other hand, the num_wows implies that such content also has the capacity to surprise or exceed expectations, leading to higher engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "INTERPRETATION 2\n",
    "The final component, PC2, the important feature is num_angrys (0.63) with a strong positive loading. This indicates that it captures the social media content that triggers user discontent. This component might be representative of provocative content that divides viewers and elicits a strong emotional reaction, particularly one of annoyance or frustration. This suggests that the content is likely causing a stir and provoking a negative response. It reflects the kind of posts that spark a heated reaction and get people fired up."

    "Based on the Scree Plot analysis, which displays the variance explained by each principal component, three clusters were selected as they capture the majority of the data's structure. The first principal component (PC0) explains the highest variance, indicating its significance in representing the underlying patterns in the data. The second principal component (PC1) also contributes substantially to the variance explained, albeit less than PC0. Beyond PC1, the rate of variance explained begins to diminish, as indicated by the flattening of the curve in the Scree Plot after the third principal component. This 'elbow' in the plot suggests that PC0 through PC2 are the most informative components for understanding the dataset, with additional components adding progressively less explanatory power. Therefore, I think that focusing on these three clusters allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the data while minimizing information loss.\n",

In Segment 0, where content appeal and acceptance are high and user engagement is moderate, photo posts may perform exceptionally well. These photos likely feature visually appealing content such as product images, scenic views, or inspirational quotes, attracting positive engagement from users. In Segment 1, characterized by low engagement and content appeal but slight user discontent, video posts might be prevalent. Videos could fail to capture users' interest or fail to resonate with the audience, resulting in lower engagement levels and possibly some negative feedback. In Segment 2, with high user engagement but lower content appeal and acceptance, text-based status updates or links to articles may dominate. Despite the high engagement, these posts may spark controversy or disagreement, leading to mixed reactions from users and contributing to the lower content appeal scores."
